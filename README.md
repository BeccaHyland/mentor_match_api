# Mentor Match (API)

## Introduction
  Mentor Match is an app for internal staff and student use at Turing School of Software & Design. In Module 1, Turing students have the opportunity to be matched to a software development mentor, usually an alumni, so this app gives admin tools to manage the matching process.

 In later Modules, students also contact alumni for short-term mentoring as a part of students' Professional Devlelopment curriculum, such as mock interviews and individual coffee meetings. Students can log in to the app to search for mentors in areas of interest and to connect.

In this repo, you will find the code and documentation for the Mentor Match back end, which provides the database and API endpoints for the Mentor Match Project and is deployed at https://mentor-match-api.herokuapp.com/

 Mentor Match is also deployed to a staging environment.

## <a name="initial-setup"></a>Initial Setup
Run locally:
1. Clone the repo found here: (https://github.com/BeccaHyland/mentor_match_api)
2. Run `bundle` from the CLI.
3. Run `rails s`
4. Using `localhost:3000` as the base of your url in browser, add the endpoint of your choice.  See below.

## API Endpoints
This is documentation for the prototype endpoints which will be deprecated shortly. Visit [here](https://github.com/BeccaHyland/mentor_match_api/blob/master/README_endpoints.md) for up-to-date endpoint documentation.

All successful database requests return JSON in an easy-to-consume format generated by the [fast_jsonapi gem](https://github.com/Netflix/fast_jsonapi). To supply the Front End app with data, this project provides the following endpoints:
## <a name="mentor-endpoints"></a>Mentor Endpoints
### 1.  All mentors in the database:
  GET `/api/v1/mentors` *currently unsecured, authorization coming soon*
  * returns JSON in the following format:
