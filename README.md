## <a name="introduction"></a>Introduction
  Mentor Match is an app for internal staff and student use at Turing School of Software & Design, planned in partnership with real clients. In this repo, you will find the code and documentation for the Back End, which provides the database and API endpoints for user by the Mentor Match front end and is deployed at https://mentor-match-api.herokuapp.com/ Mentor Match is also deployed to a staging environment to insulate the production site from bugs.
  
#### Iteration 1: Gives admin tools to manage the matching process in which incoming Turing students have the opportunity to be mentored 1-on-1 by a software development mentor, usually an alumni.
  * Admin can filter current mentors and students by easy-to-use button attributes or a query string
  * Admin can assign and remove matches
  * New mentors can complete a detailed form to add their information to the mentor database
  * Admin can enter new students into the database

#### Iteration 2: Secures the app with an OAuth login (authentication) and differentiated access based on User role (authorization).
* JSON web tokens (JWT) are generated, and a User is identified or created in the Back End after the User clicks "Login with GitHub" on the Front End
* The Front End stores and sends the User's JWT with every API request to the Back End, where the User's identity and permissions are identified
* A new Mentor that is created is associated with the User, for future editing of the User's own information

#### Iteration 3 (in development): Gives students search functionality to locate additional mentors for short-term mentoring (coffee meetings, mock interviews) as a part of Turing's Professional Development curriculum.

## <a name="initial-setup"></a>Initial Setup
Run locally:
1. Clone the repo found here: (https://github.com/BeccaHyland/mentor_match_api)
2. Run `bundle` from the CLI.
3. Run `rails s`
4. Using `localhost:3000` as the base of your url in browser, add the endpoint of your choice.  See below:

## API Endpoints
This is documentation for the API endpoints.

All successful database requests return JSON in an easy-to-consume format generated by Netflix's [fast_jsonapi gem](https://github.com/Netflix/fast_jsonapi).

For authorization, all requests must include a token.
#### The value must be the token received by the FE (in the parameters as `token`) in the first request from the user for that login session.
##### This ensures that the user already "Logged In" - was authenticated by a Github OAuth login and role-verified by the Back End to set the user's permissions (allowed endpoints)

To supply the Front End app with data, this project provides the following endpoints:
## <a name="mentor-public-endpoints"></a>Mentor Public Endpoints
### 1.  All mentors in the database:
  GET `/api/v1/mentors`
  * returns JSON in the following format (all arrays are shown closed except the first, for easier viewing):

  <img width="1117" alt="screen shot 2019-01-01 at 7 14 23 pm" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39714935/50578640-ace1ae80-0df9-11e9-950d-c46b9fa9eab3.png">

  * Note: This is the only endpoint that does not require login or sending a token through the Authorization header.

### 2. One mentor by its id
GET `/api/v1/mentors/(INSERT ID HERE)`
* returns JSON in the following format (all arrays are shown closed except the first, for easier viewing):

<img width="787" alt="screen shot 2019-01-01 at 7 22 03 pm" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39714935/50578718-bfa8b300-0dfa-11e9-91e2-e19dbe090d12.png">

### 3. Create a new mentor in the database
POST `/api/v1/mentors`
* request must include:
#### HEADERS:
`{
"Content-Type": "application/json",
"Accept": "application/json",
"Authorization": "(token)"
}`

#### BODY:
* JSON

* The minimum required fields to create a mentor are: name, city, and email.
`{
"name": "name of mentor",
"email": "email of mentor",
"city": "city of mentor"
}`

* the database already stores defaults for the attributes `active` and `matched`, so these are NOT included with a POST.

### <a name="build-details"></a>Build Details: *(draft collection of all details, to be formatted)*

initial build command: `rails new mentor_match_api -T -d postgresql --skip-spring --skip-turbolinks`

Gems added:

general:

gem 'fast_jsonapi'
gem 'rack-cors', require 'rack/cors'
gem 'active-designer'

development & test
  gem 'rspec-rails'
  gem 'capybara'
  gem 'factory_bot_rails'
  gem 'pry'
  gem 'shoulda-matchers'
  gem 'launchy'
  gem 'database_cleaner'
  gem 'faker'


  test only
  gem 'simplecov'

 Run `rails g rspec:install`

 To rails_helper, added

 `Shoulda::Matchers.configure do |config|
  config.integrate do |with|
    with.test_framework :rspec
    with.library :rails
  end
end`
and `require 'faker'`

To spec_helper, added:
`require 'database_cleaner'`
`require 'simplecov'`
`SimpleCov.start "rails"`

within the spec_helper RSpec configure:
`config.before(:suite) do
      DatabaseCleaner.strategy = :transaction
      DatabaseCleaner.clean_with(:truncation)
    end
    config.around(:each) do |example|
        DatabaseCleaner.cleaning do
        example.run
      end
    end`

  in config/application.rb, added:
  `config.middleware.insert_before 0, Rack::Cors do
      allow do
        origins '*'
        resource '*', headers: :any, methods: [:get, :post, :options]
      end
    end` for the rack-cors gem


## <a name="known-issues"></a>Known Issues
Admin cannot currently POST a new mentor. To POST, a prospective mentor logs in with GitHub, their Mentor Match User account is created through OAuth, and their mentor intake form data is then associated with that User. A future iteration could include a feature allowing an Admin to POST a new mentor independent of a User.

## Running Tests
Run `rspec` from the CLI to run all tests.
Run `rspec` then the filepath of the test you wish to run.
