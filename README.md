# Mentor Match (API)

## Introduction
  Mentor Match is an app for internal staff and student use at Turing School of Software & Design. Incoming Turing students have the opportunity to be matched to a software development mentor, usually an alumni, and Iteration 1 of Mentor Match gives admin tools to manage the matching process.

  Nearing graduation, students also contact alumni for short-term mentoring (mock interviews, coffee meetings) as a part of Turing's Professional Development curriculum. This app provides the ability to search for mentors in areas of particular interest.

  In this repo, you will find the code and documentation for the Mentor Match back end, which provides the database and API endpoints for the Mentor Match Project and is deployed at https://mentor-match-api.herokuapp.com/
  
  Mentor Match is also deployed to a staging environment to insulate the production site from bugs.

## <a name="initial-setup"></a>Initial Setup
Run locally:
1. Clone the repo found here: (https://github.com/BeccaHyland/mentor_match_api)
2. Run `bundle` from the CLI.
3. Run `rails s`
4. Using `localhost:3000` as the base of your url in browser, add the endpoint of your choice.  See below:

## API Endpoints
This is documentation for the API endpoints.

All successful database requests return JSON in an easy-to-consume format generated by Netflix's [fast_jsonapi gem](https://github.com/Netflix/fast_jsonapi).

For authorization, all requests must include a token.
#### The value must be the token received by the FE (in the parameters as `token`) in the first request from the user for that login session.
##### This ensures that the user already "Logged In" - was authenticated by a Github OAuth login and role-verified by the Back End to set the user's permissions (allowed endpoints)

To supply the Front End app with data, this project provides the following endpoints:
## <a name="mentor-public-endpoints"></a>Mentor Public Endpoints
### 1.  All mentors in the database:
  GET `/api/v1/mentors`
  * returns JSON in the following format (all arrays are shown closed except the first, for easier viewing):

  <img width="1117" alt="screen shot 2019-01-01 at 7 14 23 pm" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39714935/50578640-ace1ae80-0df9-11e9-950d-c46b9fa9eab3.png">

  * Note: This is the only endpoint that does not require login or sending a token through the Authorization header.

### 2. One mentor by its id
GET `/api/v1/mentors/(INSERT ID HERE)`
* returns JSON in the following format (all arrays are shown closed except the first, for easier viewing):

### 3. Create a new mentor in the database
POST `/api/v1/mentors`
* request must include:
#### HEADERS:
`{
"Content-Type": "application/json",
"Accept": "application/json",

"city": "city of mentor"
}`

* the database already stores defaults for the attributes `active` and `matched`, so these are NOT included with a POST.

## <a name="known-issues"></a>Known Issues
An admin is unable to create a mentor in the database. A mentor must log in and create the user by filling out the mentor form.

## Running Tests
Run `rspec` from the CLI to run all tests.
Run `rspec` then the filepath of the test you wish to run.
